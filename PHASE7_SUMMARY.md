### Basic Workflow Execution
```python
# Create and execute a complete style analysis workflow
workflow_request = {
    "template_name": "complete_style_analysis",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "context": {
        "image_url": "https://example.com/outfit.jpg",
        "user_description": "Looking for business casual recommendations",
        "occasion": "office_meeting"
    }
}

# POST /workflows/execute
result = await orchestrator.execute_workflow(workflow_request)
```

### Asynchronous Execution with Monitoring
```python
# Start workflow asynchronously
response = await orchestrator.execute_workflow_async(workflow_request)
workflow_id = response["workflow_id"]

# Monitor execution progress
status = await orchestrator.get_workflow_status(workflow_id)
print(f"Workflow status: {status['status']}")
```

## Conclusion

Phase 7 successfully implements a production-ready service orchestration engine that transforms the Aura AI system from individual microservices into a cohesive, intelligent platform. The orchestrator provides the architectural foundation for sophisticated AI applications while maintaining high performance, reliability, and observability.

The system demonstrates enterprise-grade capabilities with comprehensive error handling, intelligent resource management, and extensive monitoring. It successfully coordinates complex multi-service workflows while providing developers with intuitive APIs and comprehensive analytics.

This orchestration layer enables the full potential of the Aura AI system, allowing for sophisticated style analysis workflows that would be impossible with individual services alone. The foundation is now in place for Phase 8 implementations that will add advanced feedback loops and learning capabilities.
