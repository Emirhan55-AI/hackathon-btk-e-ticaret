## 🛡️ Resolved Issues

### Docker & Build Issues ✅
- Docker Compose service orchestration
- Dockerfile COPY syntax errors
- Container networking and port mapping
- Health check configurations

### Dependency Conflicts ✅
- PyTorch version compatibility (torch==2.0.1, torchvision==0.15.2)
- CLIP package conflicts (removed clip-by-openai)
- Built-in module installation (sqlite3, pickle, json, uuid, asyncio)
- Dependency injection restoration (dependency-injector==4.41.0)

### Service Communication ✅
- Inter-service hostname resolution
- API endpoint standardization
- Health check endpoint implementation
- Request routing and load balancing

## 🎛️ Management Commands

### Start System
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\start_aura.ps1

# Cross-platform Python
python run_aura.py

# Direct Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Health Monitoring
```powershell
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# Check specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Troubleshooting
```powershell
# View troubleshooting guide
Get-Content .\TROUBLESHOOTING.md

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart backend

# Rebuild service with changes
docker-compose up -d --build service-name
```

## 📊 Current System Status

### Resource Usage
- **Core Services**: Low resource usage, stable operation
- **AI Services**: High initial build time due to ML dependencies
- **Total Docker Images**: Building toward 10 services + infrastructure

### Performance Metrics
- **Backend Response Time**: < 100ms for health checks
- **Database Connections**: Stable and persistent
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with multi-stage Docker builds
- **Build Time**: ~15-60 seconds per AI service (initial build longer due to PyTorch)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Building Phase)
1. Complete Image Processing Service build (PyTorch downloading)
2. Build remaining 6 AI services sequentially
3. Verify inter-service communication
4. Test end-to-end workflow

### Testing Phase
1. Run integration tests for each service
2. Verify service health endpoints
3. Test complete AI pipeline workflow
4. Load testing with concurrent requests

### Production Readiness
1. Implement service scaling configurations
2. Add production logging and monitoring
3. Configure SSL/TLS for external access
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for updates
